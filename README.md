# CryptoClustering
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze stock pricing data, specifically focusing on the relationship between trading volume and the spread between the high and low trading prices. The project also utilizes the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) to segment the data effectively.

Objectives
Data Loading and Preparation:

Load and prepare the stock pricing data for analysis.
Set up the DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex for easy manipulation and analysis.
Elbow Method Implementation:

Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset.
Visualize the elbow curve to identify the best value for k.
K-Means Clustering:

Perform K-Means clustering with the two most likely values of k identified from the elbow method.
Visualize the clusters using scatter plots to analyze the segmentation.
Analysis and Conclusion:

Analyze the impact of using fewer features on the clustering results.
Draw conclusions based on the visualized clusters and the optimal number of clusters.
